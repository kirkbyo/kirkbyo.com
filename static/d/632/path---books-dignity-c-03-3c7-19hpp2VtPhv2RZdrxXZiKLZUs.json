{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>by Chris Arnade</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(on religion...) even after I had come to see how useful religion was, I still attended services as an outsider trying to understand why faith drew so many people to it. Why it seemed to comfort those who needed it the most. In the language of the church, I wasn't saved yet. In the language of my friends, I was a scientist trying to understand religion. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Viewed from a distance, Crystal's and Andrew's decisions to stay and attend a small community college don't make much sense. Everyone is supposed to want the best education to make the best career. That is the message everyone hears, and it is how we reward people. We repeat over and over, \"Get the best education you can, go to the best school you can.\" Yet do we really want to be a society that stigmatizes a daugher or a son who stays to help their parents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(a man on living in Milwaukee...) It's people's minds that cause the problem. Man cannot enslave man; man elsaves himself. \"In the south you knew where you stood. Here they are smarter about their racism. They never show you their hand, like a snake in the grass. They talk one way and act another. They told me it was integrated here. Hell it is. Wasn't no such thing as integrated. You couldn't go north of Center Street if you were black. If you did, you weren't coming back. We knew our position then and could do something about it, unlike the young people today\".</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 30, 2019","path":"/books/dignity","title":"Dignity"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
